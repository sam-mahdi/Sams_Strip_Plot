# Sams_Strip_Plot

How to Use (for Gianluca):

Pretty self explanatory now. Add peaklist files for the experiments you ran. Again as before, peaks must all have the same nitrogen value (i.e. don't use peak center). 

Tolerance for carbon is 0.2, hydrogen 0.1 (but you can change these depending on how flexilble or stringent you want your strip plot to be). 

The CO for going backwards (i-1) is the HNCACO, using HNCO carbonyl peak. The CO for going foward is the HNCO, using the HNCACO carbonyl peak.

For NOEs, you can look at NH and HA range for comparisons. Check the box for the atoms to search (e.g. CA only checks the HNCA only, CA, CB checks HNCA and HNCACB, CA, CB, CO checks HNCA, HNCACB, and HNCACO, etc.). 

To display, simply check the display box. Carbon shows the strip plot for the 3D strip plot. The NH, HA NOE display shows the printout from the NOEs. 

To use: Simply type in the values of your atoms. 
e.g. if you want to find the i+1, type in the nitrogen of your i, the i CA, i CB, and i CO. The printout will be of other peaks (only displaying nitrogen value) that share the CA, CB, and CO values you inputted.
